The Bank Database Management System (DBMS) project using MySQL is designed to streamline and automate the management of banking operations, ensuring efficient handling of data related to customers, accounts, transactions, loans, and employees. This system provides a secure and scalable solution for managing the complex data requirements of a bank.

# Project Overview
Objective: The primary goal of this project is to create a reliable, secure, and efficient database system that can manage all aspects of banking operations, including customer management, account handling, transaction processing, and loan management.

# Technology Used: 
MySQL is the core technology used for database management due to its robust features, including support for complex queries, data integrity, and security protocols essential for banking environments.

▪️Transaction Table: Records all financial transactions performed.
▪️Loan Table: Manages loan information tied to customers.
▪️Employee Table: Keeps track of employee details involved in the bank’s operations.
Features:

Data Integrity: Ensures all transactions follow ACID principles (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) to maintain data accuracy and consistency.
▪️Security: Implements access controls and data encryption to protect sensitive information.
▪️Scalability: Designed to handle increasing data loads as the bank grows, with options for scaling both vertically and horizontally.
Benefits:

Improved Efficiency: Automates data management tasks, reducing manual errors and processing time.
▪️Enhanced Security: Protects sensitive financial data from unauthorized access.
